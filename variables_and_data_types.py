Q1 . What is python?
Ans 1. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural,
 object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used in data science, web development, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.
 
Q2 . What are the key features of python?
Ans 2. Key features of Python include:
- Easy to learn and use: Python has a simple syntax that is easy to read and write.
- Interpreted language: Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.
- Dynamically typed: Variable types are determined at runtime, allowing for flexibility.
- Extensive standard library: Python comes with a large standard library that provides modules and functions for various tasks.
- Cross-platform: Python can run on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Community support: Python has a large and active community that contributes to its development and provides support through forums and resources.

Q3 . What are variables in python?
Ans 3. Variables in Python are used to store data values. They act as containers that
    hold information that can be referenced and manipulated throughout a program. 
    In Python, you do not need to declare the type of a variable explicitly; it is inferred from the value assigned to it. Variables can hold different data types such as integers,
    floats, strings, lists, and more.

Q4 . What are the different data types in python?
Ans 4. Python has several built-in data types, including:
- Numeric types: int (integer), float (floating-point number), complex (complex number)
- Sequence types: list, tuple, range
- Text type: str (string)
- Set types: set, frozenset
- Mapping type: dict (dictionary)
- Boolean type: bool (True or False)
- None type: NoneType (represents the absence of a value)
